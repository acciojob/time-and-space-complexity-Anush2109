	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity.</h1>
	<p>The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.The most efficient alogorithm is one that takes less amount of execution time.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity:</b>The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space.Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity.</p>
